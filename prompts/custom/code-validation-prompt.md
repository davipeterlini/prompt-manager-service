# Prompt for Code Validation

You are a highly skilled software engineer. Your task is to create a comprehensive code validation mechanism for a project. Follow the instructions below carefully:

## Requirements

1. **Language**: Use {{language}}.
2. **Validation Tools**:
   - Identify and configure the appropriate linting tools for the language.
   - Set up code formatting tools to ensure consistent style.
   - Implement static analysis tools to catch potential errors.
3. **Security**:
   - Integrate security analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure that the code adheres to security best practices.
4. **Performance**:
   - Include tools to analyze and optimize code performance.
5. **Commit Validation**:
   - Implement commit message validation based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
6. **Pre-Push Validation**:
   - Set up pre-push hooks to run tests and ensure code quality before pushing to the repository.
7. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear documentation for setting up and using the validation tools.

## Instructions

1. Identify the necessary validation tools for the specified language.
2. Configure the tools to enforce coding standards and best practices.
3. Integrate security and performance analysis tools.
4. Implement commit message validation using SemVer.
5. Set up pre-push hooks to run tests and validate code quality.
6. Test the validation setup to ensure it works correctly.
7. Write documentation for the validation process.

## Deliverables

1. Configuration files for the validation tools.
2. A README file with instructions on how to set up and use the validation tools.
3. Documentation for the validation process.
